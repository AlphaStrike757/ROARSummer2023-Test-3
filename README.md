# Robot Open Autonomous Racing (ROAR)

This is an implementation for the test script validation in the ROAR summer program.

The implementation is based on the ROAR simulation by Aaron Xie with some improvements to the speed control in certain parts of the race track. 

This implementation is still a work in progress.

Setup Instructions:

1. Please use the contents of the ROAR folder in this repository
2. Please also use the runner_competition_evaluator.py since it has a new PID Controller being used
